1. Refer to a copy of the paper â€˜The restricted isometry property and its implications for compressed sensingâ€™in the homework folder. Your task is to open the paper and answer the question posed in each and every green-colored highlight. The task is the complete proof of Theorem 3 done in class. [24 points = 1.5 points for each of the 16 questions]

2. Your task here is to implement the ISTA algorithm for the following three cases:

(a) Consider the image from the homework folder. Add iid Gaussian noise of mean 0 and variance 4 (on a[0,255] scale) to it, using the â€˜randnâ€™ function in MATLAB. Thus y = x + Î· where Î· âˆ¼ N(0,4). You should obtain x from y using the fact that patches from x have a sparse or near-sparse representation in the 2D-DCT basis.

(b) Divide the image shared in the homework folder into patches of size 8 Ã— 8. Let xi be the vectorized version of the ith patch. Consider the measurement yi = Î¦xi where Î¦ is a 32Ã—64 matrix with entries drawn iid from N(0,1). Note that xi has a near-sparse representation in the 2D-DCT basis U which is computed in MATLAB as â€˜kron(dctmtx(8)â€™,dctmtx(8)â€™)â€™. In other words, xi = UÎ¸i where Î¸i is a near-sparse vector. Your job is to reconstruct each xi given yi and Î¦ using ISTA. Then you should reconstruct the image by averaging the overlapping patches. You should choose the Î± parameter in the ISTA algorithm judiciously. Choose Î» = 1 (for a [0,255] image). Display the reconstructed image in your report. State the RMSE given as kX(:)âˆ’XË†(:)k2/kX(:)k2 where XË† is the reconstructed image and X is the true image. [16 points]

(c) Repeat the reconstruction task using the Haar wavelet basis via the MATLAB command â€˜dwt2â€™ withthe option â€˜db1â€™. Display the reconstructed image in your report. State the RMSE. Use MATLAB function handles carefully. [8 points]

(d) Consider a 100-dimensional sparse signal x containing 10 non-zero elements. Let this signal be convolved with a kernel h = [1,2,3,4,3,2,1]/16 followed by addition of Gaussian noise of standard deviation equal to 5% of the magnitude of x to yield signal y, i.e. y = h âˆ— x + Î·. Your job is to reconstruct x from y given h. Be careful of how you create the matrix A in the ISTA algorithm. [8 points]

3. One of the questions that came up in a live session was the notion of an oracle. Consider compressivemeasurements y = Î¦x + Î· of a purely sparse signal x, where . When we studied Theorem 3 in class, I had made a statement that the solution provided by the basis pursuit problem for a purely sparse

signal comes very close (i.e. has an error that is only a constant factor worse than) an oracular solution. An oracular solution is defined as the solution that we could obtain if we knew in advance the indices (set S) the non-zero elements of the signal x. This homework problem is to understand my statement better. For this, do as follows. In the following, we will assume that the inverse of Î¦TSÎ¦S exists, where Î¦S is a submatrix of Î¦ with columns belonging to indices in S.

(a) Express the oracular solution xËœ using a pseudo-inverse of the sub-matrix Î¦S. [5 points]

â€  ,T is standard notation for

(b) Now, show that. Here Î¦SS

the pseudo-inverse of Î¦S. The largest singular value of matrix X is denoted as kXk2. [3 points]

â€ 

(c) Argue that the largest singular value of Î¦S lies betweenandwhere k = |S| and Î´2k

is the RIC of Î¦ of order 2k. [4 points]

(d) This yields . Argue that the solution given by Theorem 3 is only a

constant factor worse than this solution. [3 points]

4. If s &lt; t where s and t are positive integers, prove that Î´s â‰¤ Î´t where Î´s,Î´t stand for the restricted isometry constant (of any sensing matrix) of order s and t respectively. [8 points]

5. Here is our obligatory Google search question :-). Your task is to find out any one paper from within the last

6. Consider the problem P1: minxkxk1 s. t. . Also consider the LASSO problem which seeks to minimize the cost function . If x is a minimizer of J(.) for some value of Î» &gt; 0, then show that there exists some value of for which x is also the minimizer of the problem P1. [6 points] (Hint: Consider . Now use the fact that x is a minimizer of J(.) to show that it is also a

minimizer of P1 subject to an appropriate constraint involving
